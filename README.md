# Deep Learning Assignment 1
> This repository contains the notebooks that were used to train the models during assignment 1.

## Notebooks in this repository:
- **1-ft-no-hyp.ipynb**:  This notebook contains the code used to fine-tune `ResNet50` and `InceptionV3` models without any hyperparameter tuning.
- **2-ft-hyp-lr.ipynb**:  This notebook contains the code used to fine-tune `ResNet50` and `InceptionV3` models with learning rate=0.0002.
- **3-ft-hyp-epochs.ipynb**:  This notebook contains the code used to fine-tune `ResNet50` and `InceptionV3` models with epochs=60.
- **4-pt-no-hyp.ipynb**:  This notebook contains the code used to pre-train two simple and advanced `CNN` models without any hyperparameter tuning.
- **5-pt-hyp-lr.ipynb**:  This notebook contains the code used to pre-train two simple and advanced `CNN` models with learning rate=0.0002.
- **6-pt-hyp-epochs.ipynb**:  This notebook contains the code used to pre-train two simple and advanced `CNN` models with epochs=60.
